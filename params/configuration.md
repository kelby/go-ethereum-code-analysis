链配置：

```go
// ChainConfig is the core config which determines the blockchain settings.
//
// ChainConfig is stored in the database on a per block basis. This means
// that any network, identified by its genesis block, can have its own
// set of configuration options.
type ChainConfig struct {
}
```

网络配置、协议配置等。
