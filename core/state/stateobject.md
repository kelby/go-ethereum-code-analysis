```go
// stateObject represents an Ethereum account which is being modified.
//
// The usage pattern is as follows:
// First you need to obtain a state object.
// Account values can be accessed and modified through the object.
// Finally, call CommitTrie to write the modified storage trie into a database.
type stateObject struct {
	address  common.Address
	addrHash common.Hash // hash of ethereum address of the account
	data     Account
	db       *StateDB

	// DB error.
	// State objects are used by the consensus core and VM which are
	// unable to deal with database-level errors. Any error that occurs
	// during a database read is memoized here and will eventually be returned
	// by StateDB.Commit.
	dbErr error

	// Write caches.
	trie Trie // storage trie, which becomes non-nil on first access
	code Code // contract bytecode, which gets set when code is loaded

	originStorage  Storage // Storage cache of original entries to dedup rewrites, reset for every transaction
	pendingStorage Storage // Storage entries that need to be flushed to disk, at the end of an entire block
	dirtyStorage   Storage // Storage entries that have been modified in the current transaction execution
	fakeStorage    Storage // Fake storage which constructed by caller for debugging purpose.

	// Cache flags.
	// When an object is marked suicided it will be delete from the trie
	// during the "update" phase of the state transition.
	dirtyCode bool // true if the code was updated
	suicided  bool
	deleted   bool
}
