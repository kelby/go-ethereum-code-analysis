```go
// statePrefetcher is a basic Prefetcher, which blindly executes a block on top
// of an arbitrary state with the goal of prefetching potentially useful state
// data from disk before the main block processor start executing.
type statePrefetcher struct {
	config *params.ChainConfig // Chain configuration options
	bc     *BlockChain         // Canonical block chain
	engine consensus.Engine    // Consensus engine used for block rewards
}
