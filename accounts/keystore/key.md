```go
type Key struct {
	Id uuid.UUID // Version 4 "random" for unique id not derived from key data
	// to simplify lookups we also store the address
	Address common.Address
	// we only store privkey as pubkey/address can be derived from it
	// privkey in this struct is always in plaintext
	PrivateKey *ecdsa.PrivateKey
}
```
