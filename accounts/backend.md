是个接口：

```go
// Backend is a "wallet provider" that may contain a batch of accounts they can
// sign transactions with and upon request, do so.
type Backend interface {
	// Wallets retrieves the list of wallets the backend is currently aware of.
	//
	// The returned wallets are not opened by default. For software HD wallets this
	// means that no base seeds are decrypted, and for hardware wallets that no actual
	// connection is established.
	//
	// The resulting wallet list will be sorted alphabetically based on its internal
	// URL assigned by the backend. Since wallets (especially hardware) may come and
	// go, the same wallet might appear at a different positions in the list during
	// subsequent retrievals.
	Wallets() []Wallet

	// Subscribe creates an async subscription to receive notifications when the
	// backend detects the arrival or departure of a wallet.
	Subscribe(sink chan<- WalletEvent) event.Subscription
}
```

当前共有 5 套实现。

抽象的概念，和 Wallet 息息相关。
